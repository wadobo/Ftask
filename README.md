## Ftask

That's a simple task TODO list proof of concept application using
flask and mongodb in server part and backbone in client side.

## Supported platforms

**Note**: In all the not tested platforms should, at least, partially work.
I'll try to extend the testing to all the platforms but right know I can only
ensure FTask works on Firefox Nigthly. 

Fixes for the failures on the above listed platforms are on the way.
